# Project Assumptions and Limitations

## Overview
This document outlines the key assumptions, limitations, and considerations for the Netflix Content Analytics project.

## Data Assumptions

### Dataset Completeness
- **Assumption**: The Kaggle dataset represents a comprehensive snapshot of Netflix's content library
- **Limitation**: Data is from September 2021 and may not reflect current Netflix catalog
- **Impact**: Analysis represents historical trends rather than current state

### Data Accuracy
- **Assumption**: All data fields are accurately populated and correctly formatted
- **Limitation**: Some fields may contain missing or inconsistent data
- **Impact**: Analysis may exclude titles with incomplete information

### Content Classification
- **Assumption**: Genre classifications (listed_in) are accurate and consistent
- **Limitation**: Netflix may use different classification systems internally
- **Impact**: Genre analysis reflects public-facing categorization

## Technical Assumptions

### Database Performance
- **Assumption**: PostgreSQL can handle the dataset size efficiently
- **Limitation**: Large queries may require optimization for production use
- **Impact**: Analysis scripts may need performance tuning for larger datasets

### Data Processing
- **Assumption**: CSV export/import processes work reliably
- **Limitation**: Large datasets may cause memory issues in Power BI
- **Impact**: May need to implement data refresh strategies

### System Requirements
- **Assumption**: Standard development environment with sufficient resources
- **Limitation**: Docker containerization may require specific system configurations
- **Impact**: Setup may vary across different operating systems

## Business Assumptions

### Content Strategy
- **Assumption**: Netflix's content acquisition follows identifiable patterns
- **Limitation**: Internal decision-making processes are not visible in the data
- **Impact**: Analysis provides insights but not complete strategic understanding

### Market Dynamics
- **Assumption**: Content popularity correlates with Netflix's acquisition decisions
- **Limitation**: Viewership data is not included in the dataset
- **Impact**: Analysis focuses on content availability, not consumption

### Geographic Distribution
- **Assumption**: Country of origin indicates content production location
- **Limitation**: Co-productions and international collaborations may be misclassified
- **Impact**: Geographic analysis may not reflect true production relationships

## Analysis Limitations

### Temporal Analysis
- **Assumption**: Release year and date_added provide meaningful temporal insights
- **Limitation**: Content may be re-released or re-categorized over time
- **Impact**: Timeline analysis may not capture all content lifecycle events

### Genre Analysis
- **Assumption**: Multiple genres per title provide comprehensive categorization
- **Limitation**: Genre overlap may create double-counting in some analyses
- **Impact**: Genre distribution may not sum to total title count

### Creator Analysis
- **Assumption**: Director and cast credits are complete and accurate
- **Limitation**: Some credits may be missing or incomplete
- **Impact**: Creator popularity analysis may be incomplete

## Power BI Dashboard Limitations

### Data Refresh
- **Assumption**: CSV exports can be refreshed manually or automatically
- **Limitation**: No direct database connection for real-time updates
- **Impact**: Dashboard requires manual refresh to stay current

### Visualization Complexity
- **Assumption**: Standard Power BI visuals can handle the data volume
- **Limitation**: Complex interactions may impact performance
- **Impact**: May need to simplify visualizations for optimal performance

### User Experience
- **Assumption**: Dashboard users have basic Power BI familiarity
- **Limitation**: Advanced features may require training
- **Impact**: User adoption may depend on skill level

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Data Quality
- **Strategy**: Implement comprehensive data validation in loading scripts
- **Action**: Add data quality checks and error handling
- **Benefit**: Reduced risk of analysis errors

### Performance
- **Strategy**: Optimize SQL queries and database indexes
- **Action**: Monitor query performance and implement optimizations
- **Benefit**: Faster analysis and better user experience

### Documentation
- **Strategy**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of all processes
- **Action**: Document assumptions, limitations, and workarounds
- **Benefit**: Easier troubleshooting and maintenance

## Future Considerations

### Data Updates
- **Consideration**: Regular dataset updates from Kaggle or other sources
- **Action**: Implement automated data refresh processes
- **Benefit**: Keep analysis current and relevant

### Enhanced Analysis
- **Consideration**: Additional data sources (viewership, ratings, etc.)
- **Action**: Plan for data integration and expanded analysis
- **Benefit**: More comprehensive insights

### Production Deployment
- **Consideration**: Move from development to production environment
- **Action**: Implement proper monitoring, logging, and error handling
- **Benefit**: Reliable production system
